Intended to be a one page document for simple present worth calculations of regular series in discrete time and a codification of the definitions of basic accounting ratios that I use in my EC314 course at Portland State University.  EC314 is a hybrid of a regular Engineering Economics course and a personal finance course that was constructed to satisfy the general education requirements and the legal requirements that engineers face in Oregon.
